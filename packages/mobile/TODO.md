Hot reloading doesn't seem to work right. When the webapp is changed, the Expo app will hot reload but oftentimes the webview will report an error or a blank screen and you'll have to restart the app (meaning you don't really get hot reload)
I thought at one point i fixed some state resetting problems and it was working nicely again (temporarily)

Change the status bar color
AppBar needs some padding - amount TBD

Android builds fail in beta and release - Looks like https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/23265. Does this workaround work? https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/23265#issuecomment-1662709655
Well, or if you just publish the packages to the NPM repository, that would solve it for the release case. For local builds, you can continue using yarn link, and we have a viable workaround in local development and alpha mode.

In the interest of being able to maintain a future where [mobile] references [web] via a package number...
I suppose that when [web] builds, it should just copy its files into its dist folder (or output or whatever you want to name it).
[mobile] should have a postinstall script that looks in its node_modules, finds the webapp and copies the relevant files (web-dist and src/autogenerated) into the right place. Ok, well now src/autogenerated is done, but copying web-dist remains.

Also, if you're even more ambitious, maybe [web] shouldn't generate autogenerated source directly, but rather like a JSON file or something. Or idk, but at least it'd make more sense for the consumers [mobile] and [electron] to take a larger responsibility for generating their autogenerated source.
Well, part of the reason it is so tightly coupled is because of hot reloading. I guess the implication is that [mobile] needs to watch the relevant node_modules folder and re-generate the autogenerated source, rather than having [web] take responsibility for dumping it into it's consumers' folders.
