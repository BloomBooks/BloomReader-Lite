Android builds fail in beta and release - Looks like https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/23265. Does this workaround work? https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/23265#issuecomment-1662709655
Well, or if you just publish the packages to the NPM repository, that would solve it for the release case. For local builds, you can continue using yarn link, and we have a viable workaround in local development and alpha mode.

In the interest of being able to maintain a future where [mobile] references [web] via a package number...
I suppose that when [web] builds, it should just copy its files into its dist folder (or output or whatever you want to name it).
[mobile] should have a postinstall script that looks in its node_modules, finds the webapp and copies the relevant files into the right place.

Also, if you're even more ambitious, maybe [web] shouldn't generate autogenerated source directly, but rather like a JSON file or something. Or idk, but at least it'd make more sense for the consumers [mobile] and [electron] to take a larger responsibility for generating their autogenerated source.
