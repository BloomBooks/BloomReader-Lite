The BookCollection, Book, and Shelf file are duplicated between shared-types and in mobile. It'd be ideal to deprecate it from mobile and be in shared-types instead.
Is shared-types even the right name? What if it should include mroe than shared-types, but actual functions and class implementations and stuff? Maybe it should be "common" or "shared"
