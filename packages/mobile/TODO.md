Hot reloading doesn't seem to work right. When the webapp is changed, the Expo app will hot reload but oftentimes the webview will report an error or a blank screen and you'll have to restart the app (meaning you don't really get hot reload)
I thought at one point i fixed some state resetting problems and it was working nicely again (temporarily)

Change the status bar color
AppBar needs some padding - amount TBD

Android builds fail in beta and release - Looks like https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/23265. Does this workaround work? https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/23265#issuecomment-1662709655
Well, or if you just publish the packages to the NPM repository, that would solve it for the release case. For local builds, you can continue using yarn link, and we have a viable workaround in local development and alpha mode.

Part of the reason [web] was so tightly coupled is because of hot reloading. I guess the implication is that [mobile] needs to watch the relevant node_modules folder and re-generate the autogenerated source, rather than having [web] take responsibility for dumping it into it's consumers' folders.
Also, if you're even more ambitious, maybe [web] shouldn't generate autogenerated source directly, but rather like a JSON file or something.

The jsAsset part of things is broken.
