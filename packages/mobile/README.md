# @bloom-reader-lite/mobile

Expo/React Native driver wrapping @bloom-reader-lite/app goes here

# Development Notes

After updating something in the "shared" package, you often need to manually Restart Typescript Server (use Ctrl+Shift+P in Visual Studio) before it gets the updates, unfortunately. I'm not sure why it has trouble picking it up.
I guess it may have something to do with using a local package. (Typescript path alias picked up the updates almost instantly)
