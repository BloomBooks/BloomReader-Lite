# BloomReader-Lite

A cross-platform version of BloomReader (with reduced feature set)

Not a monorepo right now because of lots of pain getting all the dependencies to work right (both when fully hoisted and with some nohoist). Just having separate packages co-existing inside the same repo.

# Getting Started

[PLEASE CLICK HERE ](https://github.com/BloomBooks/BloomReader-Lite/blob/master/packages/mobile/README.md) to read the mobile package's README for detailed instructions on getting started

### Environment Setup

You can either open one VSCode window to edit all the packages, or you can open up one VSCode window per package. It's up to you.
