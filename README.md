# BloomReader-Lite

A cross-platform version of BloomReader (with reduced feature set)

Not a monorepo right now because of lots of pain getting all the dependencies to work right (both when fully hoisted and with some nohoist). Just having separate things inside the same repo.

##

Right now, I recommend opening packages/mobile and packages/web in separate VSCode windows. I think it makes it easier to keep straight what you're working on that way. But it's up to you.
